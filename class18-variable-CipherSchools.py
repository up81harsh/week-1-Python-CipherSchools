# rule for naming a variable:
# variable cannot start with a number for eg. 1number =4
# we can start our variable with underscore(_) . we cannot use special symbols(% ,$,&)
# convention for naming a variable:
#variables can be separated by underscore .for eg.
# user_one_name = "rahul"  (this is snake case writing)
# userOneName = "rahul"    (this is called camel case writing)
